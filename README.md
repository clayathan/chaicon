# Chaicons - Free to Use Pixel Icon Set

An assortment of F2U 16x16 icons (and other sizes), originally made for the Chaipet pet site framework (which is currently being made lol). These are still a work-in-progress, so new icons may be getting added in the future.

You're free to use these as you please! :^)
